#+title: Diplomacy Today

* What is this?

This is a continuation of ~nraw~'s project to automatically create AI-generated newspapers based on HTML-templating and the utilization of OpenAI's API. It has been used by me in a number of games and I have made iterative improvements based on the input of the other players. These include, but are not limited to;

- A title based on the headlines of the articles.
- Improvements to the phrasing of the AI.
- The removal of the tedious summaries.
- News based on real life events that occur outside of Europe on the given season.
  - These can sometimes run into issues, such as spring 1914 often times resulting in reports on the beginnings of WW1, after players have already been fighting for 14 years. 
- More realistic news articles, with comments made by people involved.
- The ability for players to login and issue comments on the situation that then turns into in-universe articles (plausible deniability on phrasing!).

* How do I use the project?

The project was originally intended just to be used for students of class TE21D at the Stockholm Science & Innovation School (SSIS), but work is slowly being done to improve portability and deployability. For now this is what you can do:

- Set the ~OPENAI_API_KEY~ environment variable.
- Set the url of your backstabbr game in ~get_backstabbr.py~.

The program is run by executing the ~main.py~ file which then generates the appropriate pictures in ~./assets~ and the ~index.hmtl~. These as well as the ~style.css~ file should be pushed to a server where they can then be viewed.

To allow players to issue declarations or comment on geopolitical affairs through the newspaper, change the passwords in ~users.json~, distribute the credentials to your players and run run the ~app.py~ script. The ~data.json~ file is intended to be purged between each turn so that only powers that actually want to say something are included in the next issue.

** Dependencies

The major dependency is on selenium and through it Mozilla Firefox or a geckodriver compatible browser. Other dependencies are:

- ~tqdm~
- ~jinja2~
- ~flask~ and ~flask-login~ (for the commentaries)

* Why does it take so long to run?

There is a timer between each call to the OpenAI API. This is because the number of units performing orders of interest later on in the game triggers OpenAI's rate-limiter. Personally I find this unnecessary on OpenAI's part since they have an underlying rate-limiter in the price of the API service. If you want to improve the speed at which it is run (To test things out perhaps?) simply remove the ~time.sleep(3)~ code on line 31 in ~ping_gpt.py~.
   
Have fun!
